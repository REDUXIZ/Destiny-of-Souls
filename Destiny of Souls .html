	<h4><i> Summary </i></h4><hr>

<p>

 These are presented in a form of case studies and Newton asserts that they uncover the hidden aspects of the spirit world.

	<h4><i>Reception</i></h4><hr>

<p>
Publishers Weekly in their review said that this book was "a rich volume, chock-full of interviews and fascinating first-person narratives, 
this book is nonetheless not for the uninitiated; Newton sometimes fails to explain his terminology, so readers who do not know much about "lives between lives" may feel lost.
 More informed readers, however, will find this a feast, and Newton a charming host. Destiny of Souls won the Independent 
 Publisher Book Award in 2001 in the New Age category,one of 49 categories of this annual award.
